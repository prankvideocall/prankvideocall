Our application does not use the Facebook login and we do not save your personal data in our server. As per Facebook policy, we have to provide User Data Deletion Callback URL or Data Deletion Instructions URL.

So you won't have to do this for our app because we don't use facebook login on our app.

But If you want to delete your activities from any application, you can remove your information by following these steps:

Go to your Facebook Account's Setting & Privacy. Click Settings.
Look for applications and Websites and you will see all of the apps and websites you linked with your Facebook.
Search and click the applications you need in the search bar.
Scroll and click Remove.
Congratulations, you have successfully removed your app activities.
